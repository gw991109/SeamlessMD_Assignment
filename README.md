To whom it may concern,

The assignment in this directory is completed as required by the SeamlessMD internship selection process.

The web application is completed in python using flask and can be run directly via the main.py file, given flask is installed. Please enter the number of patients to be fetched and click submit in order to view the data on these patients. As the provided server is a sandbox server, I believe there are times when patients queried return with no information at all besides patient number, in which case all columns with missing information will display "N/A".

The navigation bar up top will allow you to navigate between pages and allow you to fetch a new sample of patients of a different size if you wish to do so.

While there was one requirement asking to make a view displaying the total number of patients fetched and their average age, it didn't seem to make much sense to display them in any other form but in a list, so I've decided to display them like so under the summary tab in the navigation bar.

Thank you for considering me as a candidate.

Best,
Gerald
